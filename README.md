# Dog-Breed - Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a model that can be used within an app to process images.
Given an image of a dog, it will estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed. 

AUsing CNN models for classification, this project highlights the challenges involved in adding a series of models designed to perform various tasks.

For Better understanding, please check report.pdf file... it will take you in a journey to explore the CNN models and their variances.


## Notes

1. This project is the capstone project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree and it was a great picture-completing part with the flowers classifier int eh Machine Learning Nanodegree project .. I really enjoyed both of them.

2. I didn't upload all data here per the following Submission Instructions:


When you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.
- Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. __Please do not include the project data sets in the `dogImages/` or `lfw/` folders.  Likewise, please do not include the `bottleneck_features/` folder.__

Alternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.

## Disclaimer
This project is open-source. You can use any part of the code/report freely.
