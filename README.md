# Dog-Breed---Capstone-Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a model that can be used within an app to process images.
Given an image of a dog, it will estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed. 

AUsing CNN models for classification, this project highlights the challenges involved in adding a series of models designed to perform various tasks.

For Better understanding, please check report.html file... it will take you in a journey to explore the CNN models and their variances.


## Note

This project is the capstone project for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree and it was a great picture-completing part with the flowers classifier int eh Machine Learning Nanodegree project .. I really enjoyed both of them.
